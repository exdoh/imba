                            A Change Maker is a new kind of entrepreneur, with some very special characteristics,

                            They work in existing companies, too. And the government. And universities. 
                            And non-profit organizations. And yes, they may also start companies,

                                    2) The vertical part of the T represents most of the second year, where students develop ideas into opportunities, find customers, and come up with a workable business plan that they must defend in front of an investment committee.
