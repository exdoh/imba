<p>On March 5<sup>th</sup>, 2011 the IMBA Army Party Night: IMBA alumni party. It&rsquo;s a gathering between IMBA professors, alumni, current students and our lovely IMBA administrators. This year party theme is &ldquo;Army&rdquo;.&nbsp;The party was held at Glen Bar, Pullman Hotel. With the effort of IMBA batch 7, we had turned Glen Bar into the atmosphere of military boot camp.</p>
<div>Our guests started to arrive around 6 o&rsquo;clock, all dressed up with green, khaki, camouflage and navy blue bringing the party to army ambience. Inside the bar, food and drinks are provided for our guests to enjoy. Dr. Edward gave opening speech to start the party around 7pm.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>When guests had mostly arrived, the activities and shows begun. We had a wonderful music band from IMBA batch 6 to entertain us with the music all night. From batch 7 we had a dance show by the student president himself dancing to Bird Thongchai hit song, Too much, so much, very much and Mhok lae Kwan. Surely, IMBA got more talents than just studying.&nbsp;Later on, we had a lucky draw to give out memorable gifts following by some games and costumes contest. Our costume winners came to the party under the concept &ldquo;military fashion&rdquo; and I must say that they deserve the prizes!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Students, professors and IMBA staffs had great time together that night. The party allowed everyone to mingle and connected. Alumni got to know what is going on in IMBA and the current students got to learn from the alumni how they got through the course and life after graduated. Though the night had come to and end but friendship remains.</div>
