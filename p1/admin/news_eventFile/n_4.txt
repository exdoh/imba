<p>Siam Heat Service Team was one of the six finalists in the MAI Bangkok Business <a href="mailto:Challenge@Sasin">Challenge@Sasin</a> 2008 (BBC) one Feb 28 - Mar 1 2008.&nbsp; The five members of the team are graduate students from IMBA porgram of Thammasat Business School.&nbsp; Siam Heat Service provides the metal surface treatment called Notrotec that could make the metal 3 times harder, 2 times strong with high corrosin resistance and dimension control.</p>
<p>The BBC is arraged by Sasin and MAI - Market for Alternative Investment.&nbsp; The sixth competition of the MAI Bangkok Business Challenge consisted of 45 teams, 34 universitites from 17 countries, frpresenting five continents.&nbsp; The judges selected the final 16 teams from the business plan's executive summay to present their full plans and divided the teams into 4 groups.&nbsp; Siam Heat Service was in group A which indluded the Kellogg School of Management from USA, Seoul National University from Korea and Reykjavik University from Iceland.&nbsp; The winner of each group will go to the final round.</p>
<p>Siam Heat Service presented a company that provides a superior metal surface treatment with lower cost to serve 3 key industries, including moulding, motorcycle and automotive.&nbsp; We saw the business opportunity from the eco car trend and the government supporting the automotive manufacturers to push Thailand to be the Detroit of Asia.&nbsp; In the first round the judges saw that we had a strong service but perceived that there is nothing in this world which is both good and cheap, and that the business model is the key that has to be clear and well communicated.&nbsp; For these reasons, we were not group A's representative and ended upas one of the last two teams in the six final teams.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the great comments from our first round judges got us back to discuss and work harder together with our advisers to go through every point and prepare for the play-off.&nbsp; Team work was the most important thing.&nbsp; We could not go through every problem, every milestone and reach the goal without collective focus.&nbsp; As a result, we were one of the last two teams.</p>
<p>After the happy announcement, it was the hardest time.&nbsp; We had to cut the presentation from 15 minutes to 10 minutes.&nbsp; Fortunatel, SHS was the last team to present, so we had 3 hours for our preparation.&nbsp; The six final teams consisted of teams from Denmark, Iceland, India, Australia, and 2 Thailand teams.&nbsp; When the showtime came, we did not our best in the presentation and answered the questions, but we did not reach the goal.&nbsp; The winner of this competition was the Denmak team.</p>
<p>If someone asked us about the competition, we would say that it is one of our proudest moments in our lives.&nbsp; This business plan competition prouvided us the valuable expericnce in real business approach and friends from around the world.&nbsp; Thanks to BBC organizers, all eam members, and our advisers for supporting us to go as far as we could and thanks to the IMBA program for providing us with this wonderful opportunity.</p>
