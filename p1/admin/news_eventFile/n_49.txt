This technology has been developed for 9 years to get the patent. This technology is called &ldquo;Tubular Denitrification Reactor&rdquo; (TDNR) which is used for recirculation system of aquatic animal farms such as fish and shrimp which are the most lucrative export product of Thailand. aquaREAL is a recirculating aquaculture system(RAS) for aquatic animals. This new farming method will help Thai shrimp farmers whose farm are small, conservative and family business, to manage the risk of crop failure to better comparing&nbsp;to the current farming method. The current one destroys the huge land and creates a large amount of toxic wastewater to environment.</div>
