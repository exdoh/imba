<p><span style="font-size: 9.5pt">Hundreds of years after being the rich land that the Europeans sought to conquer but discovered America instead, India today still remains as a destination for learning and opportunity.&nbsp; Most of us knew very little about Mumbai prior to the trip.&nbsp; So when we landed and found ourselves stuck in traffic with 18 million people, we learned fast that it is a huge and rapidly developing city, despite the bad roads and chaos.&nbsp; More importantly, we found that there was much more to the stretches of slums and street dwellings, because the businesses that we looked at in-depth allowed us to see a breeding ground for the future of new ideas, business opportunities, and the success of self-reliance built by communities.<br />
<br />
</span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt">In the first part of the trip we had a lot of fun with the students from the European Business School, who came to Thailand first to see the global supply chains around Bangkok and then went to Mumbai with us to see outsourcing businesses.&nbsp; We had morning classes led by professors and speakers from SP Jain Institute of Management at the Club, where we had delicious local Indian food, Italian pasta, and fake but tasty Oriental stir-fries, followed by exquisite ice cream and other desserts.<br />
<br />
</span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt">The afternoon sessions consisted of company visits, including Tata Consulting Services and Mahindra &amp; Mahindra, to name a few.&nbsp; These visits were quite valuable for both the EBS students and us IMBA students.<br />
<br />
</span><span style="font-size: 9.5pt">The EBS students left after three days, and we continued the journey with Ajarn Ed, delving into the world of social entrepreneurship.&nbsp; Impressed by the social impact and business success of Fabindia, a clothing, fabric, and decor company that employs more than 40,000 women to weave organics at home, we went to support the business at the stores several times, coming home with about a ton of new clothes and gifts.&nbsp; Everyone was fully satisfied both as responsible consumers of socially and environmentally responsible businesses and expert shopaholics. </span></p>
