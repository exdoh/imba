<p><span style="font-size: small"><span style="font-family: Verdana"><span style="line-height: 115%">Even though I was back from Laos for 2 weeks now, every moment of our Exit Trip still keeps alive on my brain. The Exit Trip was hosted by IMBA for our class who finished all classes here and is now in the line of graduation. I remembered that when I heard from IMBA office that the Exit Trip 2011 was Laos, I instantly said &ldquo;Hoorey!&rdquo; Our class was really excited to be there. It was a very while ago our whole class went on a trip together. This would be wonderful. We got a little guideline and information from Ajarn Edward, our director that the trip would be adventurous in the rain forest. However, when we watched the clip of the Tree Top Explorer on YOUTUBE, it looked like a really nice and peaceful trip. We felt like the trip would be for a quiet hideaway and the adventurous activities were optional.</span></span></span><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 12pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small"><span style="font-family: Verdana"><span style="line-height: 115%">When arrived Laos, everything seemed to be different from what we imagined. During the trekking, there was heavy raining which made the walkway too rough and scraggly. Also, being city people with tiny amount of time for exercise, our physical skills were not ready for hardcore and risky outdoor activities. So, steep mountain trekking, cliff climbing, and flying on the sky-high zip line in the jungle made everyone had maximum level of adrenaline. Some of us are afraid of height. Some were very exhausted. Unplanned and unexpected activities and adventure were continuously happening till we arrived the accommodation. Despite excitement, fear and tiredness, I saw true Friendship, Courage and Spirit of my friends. We always helped each other. We waited when our friends could walk at slower paces and pulled each other&rsquo;s hand when someone fell into slippery muddy potholes. At the end, all of us were safe and we knew how much we love our batch and how much we love IMBA.</span></span></span><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 12pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small"><span style="font-family: Verdana"><span style="line-height: 115%">Like Aj Edward said to us at the end of the trip, sometimes in life, same as in business, we have to take risk and unexpected obstacles along the way. If we can overcome our fear and try to be out of our comfort zone, there are actually plenty of opportunities out there, all are waiting for us. During the tough activities of this trip, we might not think we could do it but all of us finally can finish all required adventurous activities.</span></span></span><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 12pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
