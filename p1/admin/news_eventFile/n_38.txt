<p>&nbsp;We landed at Pudong International Airport in Shanghai on Friday late afternoon with cloudy rain. Our first destination was not there but we directed to Hangzhou and Suzhou where we spent weekend and self explored Chinese market before the official lectures began in the following week.</p>
<div>Several hours away from Shanghai, Suzhou and Hangzhou are the twin cities famous for their splendid scenery. There is a Chinese saying goes as &ldquo;Shang you tiantang, xia you <b>Su-hang</b>&rdquo; or there is paradise in heaven, Su-Hang on earth&rdquo;. &nbsp;Su-Hang means Suzhou and Hangzhou. We enjoyed city tour and were impressed by thousand years of Chinese civilization. In the midst of historical and natural scenery, Urbanization has moved into the cities especially in Hangzhou. Surprisingly, every corner of the main street, lies the financial institutes and shopping complexes where world luxury brands do not miss to open their new stores to grasp local millionaires and young entrepreneurs emerging from the fast developing economy. If Su-Hang are the must place to visit for tourists, we think they are the must for investors too.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>After a relaxing weekend, we then went back to Shanghai, our main destination of this trip. As one of China&rsquo;s most populous city, Shanghai has undoubtedly become not only domestic and also world financial and commercial center. The city is surrounded by skyscrapers and many projects are currently going on including a massive construction rushing to finish by the next coming big showcase, World Expo 2010. &nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We had morning lectures at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (SUFE) or shortly called as &ldquo;Caida&rdquo; in Chinese. The comprehensive lectures given by leading Chinese professors are our valuable tools for doing business in China. Most importantly, the company visits in the afternoon session brought us to shortcut experiences of doing business in China through different types of business and investments.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Dystar, a world leading textile dyes manufacturer, represents a wholly owned foreign direct investment that could success in this big market. Shanghai Yatch Club is a private owned company, invested by an American Chinese guy who can see and capture the trend of changing lifestyle and business practices. Meanwhile, Bao Steel told us the success story of the state owned enterprise as the fifth world largest steel maker and company in fortune 500 ranking. Its factory area, as told by Public Relation Manager, is as big as Macau. We also visited the most famous Thai pioneer in China; CP group. We have learned that its success today came from mastering the failure in the past. Our touring at &ldquo;Super Brand Mall&rdquo; or &ldquo;Zheng Da&rdquo;, crowded with the Chinese shoppers could be one proof of the company&rsquo;s success in retailing business. Together we had a chance to met Chinese gurus from Kasikorn Bank and The Royal Thai Consulate who gave us more in dept business insight in China and kindly extended their stay to answer our questions. &nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Everyone was very tired after the journey but it was worthwhile. The trip gave us invaluable experience. Classes and company let us more understand about China while day and night sightseeing let us get closer to this never sleep city and its multinational dwellers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In the late 1980s, the giant dragon just woke up but thirty years later it has become stronger and is now flying higher and higher over the sky in the world. We hope to catch it and fly high with this dragon.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
