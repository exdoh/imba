<p>After we have been stunned from a memorable experience in Shanghai study trip from June 19<sup>th</sup>-26<sup>th</sup>, we got an opportunity for a company visit to THANN on July 2<sup>nd</sup>. What is THANN? To be honest, I had seen its luxurious shops in many leading department stores such as Siam Paragon and Central Plaza but I have never entered the shops and have no idea what kind of products are sold there. Talking about THANN, only 2 things I can remember when I passed by the shops. I can feel naturally classy smell and I thought this brand must be imported from somewhere like Hong Kong or Singapore.</p>
<div>I got a clear answer when I took part in the visit at THANN arranged by Dr. Patnaree Srisuphaolarn and IMBA. Starting our half-day tour by our lecturer Dr. Patnaree and IMBA program manager Miss Umaporn Hongwattananon, all IMBA students including batch 5 and 6 gathered at McDonald on ground floor of Amarin Building at 2 pm. Dr. Patnaree, then, took us to THANN shop located on the second floor of Gaysorn Plaza. When we arrived at the shop, we are welcome by International Marketing Manager, Miss Nanthida Ratanakul. It is an honor for us for being welcome by the high-level staff from THANN especially after I know what THANN have done for a decade of its history.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>When we move into the shop, it is kind of first impression. We all agreed that the shop is well decorated with classy taste. It is not such a colorful designed place but classy smell and so-much detail in its decoration can attract customers to step in. Among its customers, who were sitting at table having easy dishes of food at their seats, 15-seat-table was reserved for us in the middle of the store. Before listening to a presentation about THANN&rsquo;s history and strategies from Miss Nanthida, we were served with natural hot and cold beverages by well-dressed staffs. Hot tea especially for rose, vanilla and lemon glass teas were our favorite cups. Before having a big meal, the presentation from Miss Nanthida was started.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>Loads of information even some classified information of THANN was presented to us and I think it should not be unveiled to the public. Only non-sensitive information can be unveiled and I will get you a brief conclusion what THANN is and what it has done for a decade. </span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>THANN was founded in 2002 by Thai investors who have a strong passion with long vision to bring Thai natural cosmetic to the world. The concept of &lsquo;Reliable Natural Cosmetic&rsquo; has been applied to products under brand &lsquo;THANN&rsquo;. THANN stands for Thanyapuech in Thai. It means &lsquo;Cereal&rsquo; which can be inferred to products from the nature. Almost a decade of its history, THANN has seen a rapid growth in the international cosmetic market with series of natural products. At least 20 flagship stores of THANN are located in many countries such as United States, EU, Japan and China. With high quality of products driven by best-practical marketing strategies, THANN is considered one of the world&rsquo;s leading natural cosmetic brand.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Talking about a challenging market for THANN, it must be Japan&rsquo;s market. It was brought on the table to discuss in Q&amp;A session. Japanese customers behaviors are pretty hard to deal with. They carefully select products with quality and functions as THANN&rsquo;s partner in Japan has different working culture from other countries. THANN spent lot of time and money on market research and product development before being successful in Japan&rsquo;s market. As students of Japan Track in IMBA, we learned a lot from the presentation. Tips to do business with Japanese are impressive and we believe it will be very useful for us after graduated. For case studies, not only in Japan&rsquo;s market but also China&rsquo;s market were brought on the table. With our fresh experience from Shanghai, we also discussed and applied what we have seen and learned from Shanghai.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As students from Japan track of IMBA, although we have no chance for a study trip to Japan due to the deadly disaster in March, the study trip in Shanghai gave us a great experience. Our knowledge from the classroom and our experience from the study trip were blended, practiced and applied to the real successful business at THANN gaysorn plaza. Thanks for Miss Nanthida, THANN&rsquo;s international marketing manager for the warm welcome and the great presentation. Thanks for Miss Umaporn for good treat and a big meal. Thanks for Dr. Patnaree for teaching us and taking care of us all the time and Thanks for IMBA for giving us a great business experience both in the class and the real life.</div>
