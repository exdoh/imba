<p><span style="font-family: Arial">After weeks of preparation and information gathering and working with a dedicated team of scientific researcher team from National Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (BIOTEC), finally our efforts have paid off. Our ENZStrip team was chosen as the winner of the 2010 </span><a href="http://www.tmc.nstda.or.th/i2p/"><span style="font-family: Arial">NSTDA Idea-To-Product Competition (I2P)</span></a><span style="font-family: Arial"> on 4-5 November 2010. The NSTDA I2P Competition is an early-stage technology commercialization plan competition hosted by Technology Management Center (TMC), NSTDA. It is open to NSTDA and NSTDA-funded researchers of all disciplines who are interested in technology-focused entrepreneurship to team up with graduate business students to work together in order to create new technology opportunities. Our first and second years IMBA students, together with students from CMMU and SASIN participated in the competition.</span></p>
<div style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial">About our technology, may wonder what is &nbsp;ENZStrip; it is the trademark name of the enzyme test kit which has been developed to simplify the method of determining enzyme activity. This helps make the lives of industrial users easier through simplification and through cost and time saving. You may still wonder what the heck this product is. That was also our first reaction when we saw the technology and it took us a long while before we understood the technology. After days of discussion and information research, we learned about the technology despite our educational background. The competition really pushed our limits to learn something beyond our familiarity and this is our first impression of I2P.</span></div>
<div style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt"><span style="font-family: Arial">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Arial">But pushing our learning boundary is not the only advantage that we have gained from the competition. The competition has granted us the opportunity to learn from the real-life experts since we were assigned to the judges and coaches who are real business people and entrepreneurs. Prior to the competition date, we thought that we were well-prepared, but we found out during the semi-final round that there was a lot of room for improvements. The judges have given us a lot of good and practical suggestions to improve our product if it was to be launched commercially. After the semifinal round, we did not expect to go on to the final round, but that did not stop us from further work on the product. We continued to discuss on what the path forward would be and how we could apply the judges&rsquo; suggestions to commercially develop the product. Right after lunch, tt caught us by surprise that we went on to the final round to win the competition since other products were also great. The important thing about this competition though, was not about the first prize; it was rather about experience, about opening up the doors to new opportunities, meeting great people, and most important of all &ldquo;MOVE US TO ACTION&rdquo; just like IMBA&rsquo;s slogan.</span></div>
