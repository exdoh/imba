<p>&nbsp;<b style="text-align: justify; ">&ldquo;Having been a politician for 20 years could not make Buriram people as happy as having established Buriram United.&rdquo;</b><span style="text-align: justify; "> said Khun Nevin Chidchob, the formal national politician who has turned his back on politics and now focus on building the Buriram football team as the president of the club.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">On 29<sup>th</sup> September 2012, our IMBA batch 9 visited i-Mobile Stadium in Buriram, the home of Buriram United. Besides being showed around the stadium, we were greatly welcomed by Khun Nevin. He spent around an hour sharing his interesting stories, concepts and his valuable experiences with us. Here are some interesting points that he mentioned</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>Building i-Mobile Stadium </b>&ndash; i-Mobile Stadium is the first meet-the-international-standard stadium in Thailand owned by private sector. There are stories behind this stadium. One of it is that because no one has ever built a proper football stadium in Thailand before, acquiring a loan from bank is going to be very difficult. However, Khun Navin, looking ahead about this issue, he comes up with the stadium plan to address the bank concerns. He builds the stadium mainly with steels instead of concrete so that if the business goes bankrupt, those steels can be sold and still creates some values. He believed that there are always opportunities when we think and do things out of the box.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>The Breath of Buriram</b> &ndash; After 3 years since Khun Navin has brought in Buriram United, Buriram has now become the fastest growing province with the GDP increased by 32%. It has changed from a backcountry place to the place of opportunities for many people. It has created jobs, increased quality of life for locals, and created spiritual anchor and unite people. Moreover, Buriram now is not only well known among Thais, but also go international as one of the fastest growing football clubs. The secret ingredient is to build faith among the stakeholders especially its fans and serve them with sincerity. Therefore, with the fans&rsquo; faith and his passion, Khun Navin is able to build Buriram United to be &ldquo;the Breath of Buriram&rdquo;.</p>
