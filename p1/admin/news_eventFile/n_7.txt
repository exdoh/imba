<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt; text-align: justify"><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Tahoma">The GSVC is unique from other world-class business plan competitions in that it specifically promotes the creation and growth of successful social ventures: enterprises that create both financial and social value. Besides demonstrating that their business plan is sustainable and profitable, teams are required to provide measurable impact of the venture to either society or environment using a methodology called the Social Impact Assessment (SIA). Thammasat&rsquo;s team received $5000 for demonstrating the best implementation of the SIA for its business called SMART, or Sustainable Marine Adventures and Responsible Tourism. The team&rsquo;s SIA was recognized for presenting the most innovative and rigorous analysis of their venture's potential social and/or environmental impacts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
