Our Thammasat business plan team has hightly gained attention from the judges and investors due to our focus&nbsp;in the locally available natural gas resource, especially during this time where there are concerns from all over the world regarding the crude oil crisis. The current situation of Thailand and India are quite similar in the sense that both countries are developing country and have their own natural gas&nbsp;sources. In the past few&nbsp;years, natural gas has gained more&nbsp;attention from many means of transportation, especially taxi and passenger care. There are many supports from both government and private sectors in encouraging people convert their crude oil based vehicles to natural gas based vihicle due to its lower price and lower emission in Carbon Monoxide and Nitrous Oxide. One may notice that there were many company entered this service segment in providing conversion service for passenger vehicles, yet there are not&nbsp;many player who specialize in converting a large diesel truck into a natural gas based truck.&nbsp;The business plan team recognized this opportunity and saw&nbsp;a big opportunity in this market. The company that we selected to expand, Jaroonrat Group, has what it takes to provide the service successfully such as a well-trained staffs and engineers,&nbsp;facilities to install large trucks, machining equipments, and business connections in logistic&nbsp;segment.<br />
<br />
Overall, it has been a wonderful experience for Thammasat business plan team to compete in an international business plan competition. It has been an honor for the team to receive such a prestigious award from the judges from this&nbsp;Lock, Stock, and Trade 2008. as well as to make fame for our IMBA program, Thammasat Business School and most importantly our Country.<br />
