<p><span style="font-family: Verdana">During June 19-26, 2011 IMBA students of IB track, totaled 34 of us from Batch 6 and 7, had a wonderful opportunity to visit Shanghai, China.&nbsp;The study trip included four lectures by honorable lecturers from Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (SUFE), four companies and site visits, the entrepreneurial street activity, and a number of tourist attractions (of course both day and night) in Shanghai.&nbsp;The lecturers, one of whom was Prof. Tong who has been a visiting lecturer of IMBA, teaching China-related course, gave very interesting topics covering different areas, such as Power sector, Finance and Small business start-up in China, and Macroeconomics analysis.&nbsp;In general, all four classes were impressive and influential.&nbsp;We did not limit our study only in classroom; however, we also had a great opportunity to visit four companies from different industries.&nbsp;They were <b>Deppon Express,</b> the leading integrated service-oriented logistics provider, <b>Lenovo (Shanghai site),</b> <b>CP Lotus distribution</b> center where the managers kindly shared us the operation process.&nbsp;The last one was the <b>Greentown Real Estate</b> in Hangzhou who showed us their real estate project and related regulations.&nbsp;All of us really learned a lot from their success stories and key insight strategies devised and how big MNCs run their business in China.&nbsp;</span></p>
<div><span style="font-family: Verdana">Not only did we get to visit selected companies, we were also enjoying the entrepreneurial activities, thanks to such enthusiastic support from IDEO, a design firm that takes the human-centered, design-based approach to help organization (as well as non-profit and community) to innovate.&nbsp;They helped us learn through a workshop and coached us with a hands-on experience related to entrepreneurial concept.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the morning of the street activity, each group went to Moganshan road (where most of the small art galleries in Shanghai gather) in search of at least four entrepreneurs.&nbsp;In the afternoon, we had an opportunity to practice and grow our entrepreneurial traits and skills! We had an opportunity to do the interview under the hot and controversial issue in China right now, the &ldquo;Food Safety&rdquo;.&nbsp;Each group was assigned to conduct the informal interview, and use any other necessary skills to acquire certain information from selected person along the Food Supply chain from farmer, to distribution center, to store (Carrefour), to consumers (individual and restaurant).&nbsp;At the end, we acquired the data and shared them among us, together with the intellectual insight by IDEO.&nbsp;One of the most important lessons for us was that <b>Entrepreneur is really everywhere, and everyone can be trained to become one!</b>&nbsp;Also, we learned to overcome the barriers (new environment, new people, new language, new culture and manners, new EVERYTHING).&nbsp;At the end, we carried out a long list of possible business opportunities!&nbsp;This made us realize that <b>Opportunity is everywhere,</b> and we learn to grasp it to <b>make change for the betterment</b> (like IMBA slogan, <b>the CHANGE MAKER</b>).&nbsp;Overall, we worked out quite well, and of course, we had FUN.</span></div>

<div><span style="font-family: Verdana">Speaking about the fun stuff, we had a great time visiting many tourist attractions, ranging from the Boat Cruise on Huangpu river, West Lake in Hangzhou, Yiyuan, Tai kang lu, Xintiandi, Shanghai Acrobatics (very amazing!), the Oriental Pearl tower (256m above ground), and many other attractions both day and night!.&nbsp;The food was well arranged from traditional luxurious Chinese meals to our &ldquo;own street food&rdquo; journey at night.&nbsp;The trip was a memorable one with learning experience with the hands-on. &nbsp;Some of us even went to &ldquo;Yiwu&rdquo; to visit the largest wholesale city of China.&nbsp;We really learned and gained A LOT from this trip both in business and entrepreneurial senses.&nbsp;Thanks to Mr. Sun Yi (the coordinator from SUFE) who helped accommodate us along the whole trip, to Dr. Edward (IMBA director), Dr. Jay Wu, and Dr. Patnaree, and every key IMBA person for making this study trip a unique and unforgettable learning experience.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></div>
