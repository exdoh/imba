<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span style="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 115%">Four of us, Sakkarin Chungsiriwat, Nipon Tumkunarnon, Chidchanok Winyoopradist and Nisna Norchoovech have formed a team named EzyTEX last November to write a business plan on innovative technology from MTEC, NSTDA for preserving natural rubber . </span></div>
<div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt"><span style="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 115%">&ldquo;Thailand is center of the world&rsquo;s natural rubber production.&nbsp;Almost 70% of the world&rsquo;s natural rubber comes from us, and our neighbors, Indonesia and Malaysia. The problem with producing natural rubber is that it requires several toxic chemicals to preserve the natural rubber latex and to keep it from hardening. They are also corrosive to machinery, unhealthy for workers, and pollute the environment.&nbsp;Our natural rubber preservative fixes all of these problems; it replaces these harmful chemicals, and the only by-product is an amino acid that occurs naturally.</span><span style="font-size: 9pt; line-height: 115%">&rdquo;&nbsp;This is the 60-second pitch we gave to 500 audiences for the launch of the RICE Business Plan Competition (RBPC).It was also video recorded and live broadcasted on the radio!</span></div>
